3D vizualisation written in Python using PyQt

This was a project for a class in school.
The assignment was to create a simple 3D visualization program without using any 3D libraries.
The program shows a "world" including walls in a grid.
The walls file contains an example "world" with a few walls, that can be loaded into the program.
You can move in the world using arrow keys or W,A,S,D, rotating with Q and E.
Space places a wall two spaces in front of the "eye" and backspace deletes a wall.
